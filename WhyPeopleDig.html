<head> <title> Why People Have To Dig</title>
</head>
<body >
 <p>Long, long before our great-great-grandmothers were born, people never used to dig. They would take hoes to the garden, leave them there, and then go back in the evening to find that a portion of the shamba had been dug. They would take the hoes back to their homes and return them the next morning.
 There was in one of the villages of Bunyore a man who married a young bride. Usually, after a girl was married, she was expected to work very hard in order to be approved of as a good wife. So this woman whose name was Nyakowa woke up in the morning and started her daily duties.

 The work laid down for a young bride was quite a lot because she was expected to go to the river with a huge water pot which she had to lift on to her head all by herself. Next she had to grind a lot of millet within a very short time. These Nyakowa did with little difficulty, for she was renowned for industry long before she married her husband.

 With most of the work done, she next had to take the hoes to the shamba. As she walked towards the shamba, she pondered to herself, "If I went and started digging, wouldn't I dig a bigger area than the hoes do? And wouldn't I earn a lot of admiration in my new village?" Many questions like these flashed through her head, and she was full of excitement. By the time she reached the shamba she had already made up her mind what to do. So without hesitation Nyakowa took one of the hoes and started digging very vigorously. She expected praise from everybody who saw her. Little did she know that her rash action would end in disaster.

 <p>Indeed, she enjoyed the whole exercise from the beginning and was very proud of it. Although she thought her act a most heroic one, the ancestors were disappointed. They thought human beings were not being grateful because Nyakowa had failed to appreciate the kind offer from the god, Were Nyasaye. 
 And so the ancestors conspired with Were Nyasaye to have him end his merciful act to the people. They had been infuriated to learn that a young bride should go against this old custom which had prevailed long before they lived.

 As time went on Nyakowa started to tire of the heavy work she was doing. The sun was moving west, so she decided it was high time she retired to the village. In any case, she told herself, hadn't she done more than the hoes did by themselves? She was sure she would be praised when people came to see the work she had done.

However, in trying to please everyone, she pleased nobody. She explained what she had done, only to be met by reproach from everybody in her family and later in the whole village. Her bewilderment was such that she wished the earth could open up and swallow her. And what the people had feared proved true the next day. The hoes were taken to the shamba as usual, but they didn't dig. Those who had left them went in the evening to collect them, only to find them where they had left them.

 <p>People were therefore forced to take up their hoes and dig for themselves. And so, however strenuous it was, they were now forced to do it themselves. In the evening, people rushed to the young bride's home in anger. They were so enraged that they demanded she be sent back to her home. And so, the girl was ordered to go back to her people before anything serious was done to her.

 She immediately ran away. However, this did not change the situation. People had to continue digging since the normal custom had been violated. They had to wake up early every morning and go out to dig in the hot sun. They would only stop for lunch and then continue digging until evening.

 So, when people think of their suffering their thoughts go back to the bride who dug, and they always blame her for her silly, ignorant act. That is why in Bunyore if a suitor wishes to marry a girl he will first go and spy on her, to see how much she can dig.
